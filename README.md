# Investor Tinder

## Features:
- React for Frontend
- Express.js/Node.js + Mongodb for Backend
- JSON Server + REST Client used for prototyping and testing
- ***P.S. go to this project's Wiki to see how the project currently looks like***

## Purpose:
Help kickstart your Full Stack development journey by providing use cases and explanations on how to combine a **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) together with popular **Dependencies** to begin developing your future projects.

## Overview:
This project is the product of 100s of hours of self-studying after which I decided to compile all the knowledge I aquired into a series of explanations and tutorials written in various **.md files** to help you aquire that same knowledge in a fraction of the time it took me.

- **HTML & JSX** -> Useful HTML tags and how to embed JavaScript in them using JSX.

- **CSS** -> Useful CSS tricks and how to use CSS selectors to apply styles with higher precision.

- **React** -> Prop Usage, Conditional Rendering, Lifting State, React Router Dom, Context API, Common React Hooks...

 ## About Investor Tinder:
 This is a **Demo Invesment Web App** that showcases the most important components of developing using a MERN Stack.

 ## Future:
 A few features of this project are yet to be implemented since the focus of this project was to showcase how different technologies interact with each other. When these features are implemented the documentation will be updated. If you wish to practice your developer skills you may implement one of these features yourself and create a **Pull Request** to merge your code to this repository. 
 ### Unimplemented Features Include:
   - Window downsizing responsiveness (you could focus only on one Component).
   - Removing startups from user's portfolio.
   - User Profile editing (you may use a boolean to toggle the state of the User Profile and conditionally render each state).
   - You may also use your creativity and improve the layout or function of any Component.
